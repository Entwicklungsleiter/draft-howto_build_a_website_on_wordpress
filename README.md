# How I built a website on wordpress

## a documentation how I installed wordpress from dockerhub, configured the server and built a website on it

BTW: The website I am talking about is [https://www.bicycle-touring-howto.com](https://www.bicycle-touring-howto.com). I don't want to make a secret about it.

## Chapters:

- [setup DNS and webserver hosting](./dns_and_server_hosting.md) (DNS, Hetzner cloud)
- [server configuration basics](./server_configuration.md) (users, ssh, docker, folder structure, swap, network check)
- [webserver configuration](./webserver_configuration.md) (letsencrypt, haproxy, wordpress install from dockerhub)
- wordpress first settings, cleanup default plugins and templates
- plan the website, install OceanWP and plugins
- build the website using Elementor (free version)
- SEO with YAST and Autoptimize
- Cookie banner with Complianz
- Sitemap, Google search console, Bing search console
- caching with Redis
- user tracking with Matomo

## Required skills

Actually I am webdeveloper and of course I use this knowledge in this documentation. So less technically experienced people will consider this documentation as "too technical". Please help me to make these docs better by asking questions ... or even better send me a merge request with Your improvements.
