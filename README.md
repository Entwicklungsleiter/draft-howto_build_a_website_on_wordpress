# How to build a website on wordpress

## A documentation how I configured the server, installed wordpress and built a website on it

The website I am talking about is [https://www.bicycle-touring-howto.com](https://www.bicycle-touring-howto.com).

## Existing chapters:

- [setup DNS and webserver hosting](./docs/01_dns_and_server_hosting.md) (domain, DNS, cloud server)
- [server configuration basics](./docs/02_server_configuration.md) (users, ssh, docker, folder structure, swap, network check)
- [webserver configuration](./docs/03_webserver_configuration.md) (letsencrypt, haproxy, wordpress install from dockerhub)

## Comming up chapters:

- wordpress first settings, cleanup default plugins and templates
- plan the website, install OceanWP and plugins
- build the website using Elementor (free version)
- SEO with YAST and Autoptimize
- Cookie banner with Complianz
- Sitemap, Google search console, Bing search console
- caching with Redis
- user tracking with Matomo

## Required skills

I am web developer (PHP, Python, C#, ...) and of course I use this knowledge in this documentation. So less technically experienced people will consider parts of this documentation being "too technical". Please help me to make the docs better by asking questions ... or sending me merge requests with Your improvements.
